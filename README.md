Software License Management System â€“ Calendar for License Expiry Tracking  Developed a software license management system that helps administrators stay informed about company-owned software licenses and their respective expiration dates.



Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in Java Project

Developed a Software License Management System that keeps administrators informed about company-owned software licenses and their expiration dates. The project was divided into four tasks, covering various advanced Java topics such as terminal-based applications, database integration, desktop applications, and web development using Spring.
Project Breakdown:

Terminal Application:

Created a simplified version of the system accessible through a terminal menu.
Implemented functionalities to load and save sample data to/from files.
Followed clean code principles, ensuring reusability, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Developed and ran at least two JUnit tests to validate functionality.
Database Integration:

Modified the terminal application to integrate with a database using Hibernate ORM.
Designed a database with at least two tables, allowing full CRUD operations for software licenses.
Imported data from files to the database and used generic classes and collections to optimize data handling.
Desktop Application:

Built a desktop application using JavaFX, connected to the database created in the previous task.
Integrated exception handling and logging mechanisms to ensure system stability.
Implemented concurrency to improve application responsiveness and performance.
Web Application:

Developed a Spring-based web application with a user-friendly interface for managing licenses.
Created a RESTful web service that provided a read-only API endpoint for querying license data.
Customized the web interface to enhance user experience, focusing on accessibility and ease of use.
Technologies Used: Java (JDK 17/21), Spring Boot, JavaFX, Hibernate ORM, JUnit, MySQL, REST APIs.
